The free online course [Statistical Learning](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014/about) will start tomorrow. It will be taught by Rob Tibshirani and Trevor Hastie. It is an excellent opportunity to learn directly from the two famous professors in the field and the authors of two great textbooks on statistical learning, [An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) and [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/).
