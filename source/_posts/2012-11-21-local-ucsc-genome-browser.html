<p>I want to install a UCSC genome browser on my ubuntu workstation, to integrate and display the genomes , mostly plant genomes, with related annotations and NGS data, e.g. RNA-seq, methylation, SNPs, synteny, genome alignment, and etc.. There are also <a href="http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Other_genome_browsers" target="_blank">other genome browsers</a>, but UCSC is my favorite and can meet my needs.</p>

<p>I spent a couple of workdays building from sources and adding custom genomes. The browser is based on mysql and apache which I don't know much about, so It's not surprising I encountered tons of problems. Thank google and other kind people who posted their experiences. I feel sorry that I cannot do the same thing as them, but at least I would like to share some resources and tips.</p>

<p>1) Read the <a href="http://genome-source.cse.ucsc.edu/gitweb/?p=kent.git;a=tree;f=src/product;hb=HEAD" target="_blank">README files</a> in the sources, and follow the instructions. (You'd better understand them.)</p>

<p>2) The <a href="http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">wiki site</a> is very helpfull.</p>

<p>3) Other people's experiences. (<a href="http://bergmanlab.smith.man.ac.uk/?p=1111" target="_blank">1</a> and <a href="http://enotacoes.wordpress.com/2009/09/03/installing-a-minimal-ucsc-mirror-in-ubuntu-jaunty-64-bits/" target="_blank">2</a>)</p>

<p>4) If top bar is not showing, add the following code in apach2 conf file. (/etc/apache2/apache2.conf on my machine)
<script src="https://gist.github.com/bioops/4946649.js"></script>
5) Mysql loading local file issue in hgLOAD* scripts. I tried different solutions, but only one worked for me. I logged into mysql and run the loading command if the error appears.</p>

<p>6) Stop mysql before rsync mysql files from UCSC server.</p>

<p>7) Most mysql problems were caused by permission settings.</p>
