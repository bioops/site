<p>The increasing amount of genome sequence data is the basis for understanding life as a molecular system and for developing medical, pharmaceutical, and other practical applications. Since 1995 we have been developing knowledge-based methods for uncovering higher-order systemic behaviors of the cell and the organism from genomic and molecular information. The reference knowledge is stored in <a href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/" target="_blank">KEGG</a>, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and associated bioinformatics technologies are being developed both for basic research and practical applications.</p>

<p>Example for searching KEGG with Perl:</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/soap/" target="_blank">this</a> for more information.</p>

``` perl kegg.pl

#!/usr/bin/perl
use SOAP::Lite;
$wsdl   = 'http://soap.genome.jp/KEGG.wsdl';
$serv   = SOAP::Lite->service($wsdl);
$offset = 1;
$limit  = 5;
$top5   = $serv->get_best_neighbors_by_gene('vvi:100261203', $offset, $limit);
foreach $hit (@{$top5}) {
 print "$hit->{genes_id1}\t$hit->{genes_id2}\t$hit->{sw_score}\n";
}

```
