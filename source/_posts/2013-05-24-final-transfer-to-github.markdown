I had been using 000webhost.com to host my website till several days ago when I noticed my website was suspendend for "violating 20%+ CPU usage limit for more than 1000 times."

The 000wbehost server is good and stable. Most importantly it's free. Now, I have to transfter to another free and good web hosting service. Github is a good choice. But github does not support wordpress. I tried to transferr the website to github [before](http://bioops.info/2012/07/transfering-to-github/), but I am not comfortable to write blogs using Markdown.

It's difficult to find another free service supporting wordpress, and lots of people said the static blogging engine is much better than wordpress. Looks like I will stay here for a while.
