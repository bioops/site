<h3><a href="http://www.binatechnologies.com/company" target="_blank">About</a>:</h3>
Bina is the big data science platform accelerating personalized medicine for researchers and clinicians requiring fast, accurate and scalable genomic analysis. The word "Bina" means "knowledge" or "insight", translated from both Persian and Hebrew. We use cutting-edge big data technologies to dramatically reduce the amount of time and money required to process raw genetic data in order to generate insights for personalized medicine. Bina was started by a team of Stanford and Berkeley researchers and entrepreneurs, with the vision that whole genome sequencing (WGS) is just the beginning of a brighter future. Bina is accelerating personalized medicine, one genome at a time.
