<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
	<li>An entire organism is modeled in terms of its molecular components</li>
	<li>Complex phenotypes can be modeled by integrating cell processes into a single model</li>
	<li>Unobserved cellular behaviors are predicted by model of <em>M. genitalium</em></li>
	<li>New biological processes and parameters are predicted by model of <em>M</em>. <em>genitalium</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
Understanding how complex phenotypes arise from individual molecules and their interactions is a primary challenge in biology that computational approaches are poised to tackle. We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em> that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>5月6日的Nature同时发布了两篇研究方向非常相似的论文，揭示了染色体镶嵌性会随着年龄的增长而增加，并与癌症发生有一定关联。</p>

<p>从<a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.2271.html" target="_blank">另一篇</a>来自<a href="https://www.genevastudy.org/" target="_blank">Gene Environment Association Studies Consortium (GENEVA)</a>。他们分析了超5万人血液样本的SNP芯片数据，发现50岁以下人的基因组样本中，复制异常低于0.5%，而在50岁之后的人中迅速增长至2–3%。有很多复制异常都在以前发现的和血液癌症有关的位点上。虽然这些有“污点记录”的位点只占所发现的异常位点的3%，统计学分析表明，有复制异常的人得血液癌症的概率是正常人的十倍。</p>

<p>笔记：上面涉及到一些概率，我没仔细看文章，可能理解有错。人体细胞复制不可靠。年老的人更容易得癌症。50岁是个坎儿。生孩子要趁早。</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>De novo genome sequence assembly is important both to generate new sequence assemblies for previously uncharacterized genomes and to identify the genome sequence of individuals in a reference-unbiased way. We present memory efficient data structures and algorithms for assembly using the FM-index derived from the compressed Burrows-Wheeler transform, and a new assembler based on these called <a href="https://github.com/jts/sga" target="_blank">SGA </a>(String Graph Assembler). We describe algorithms to error-correct, assemble, and scaffold large sets of sequence data. SGA uses the overlap-based string graph model of assembly, unlike most de novo assemblers that rely on de Bruijn graphs, and is simply parallelizable. We demonstrate the error correction and assembly performance of SGA on 1.2 billion sequence reads from a human genome, which we are able to assemble using 54 GB of memory. The resulting contigs are highly accurate and contiguous, while covering 95% of the reference genome (excluding contigs &lt;200 bp in length). Because of the low memory requirements and parallelization without requiring inter-process communication, SGA provides the first practical assembler to our knowledge for a mammalian-sized genome on a low-end computing cluster.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>New sequencing technology has dramatically altered the landscape of whole-genome sequencing, allowing scientists to initiate numerous projects to decode the genomes of previously unsequenced organisms. The lowest-cost technology can generate deep coverage of most species, including mammals, in just a few days. The sequence data generated by one of these projects consist of millions or billions of short DNA sequences (reads) that range from 50 to 150 nt in length. These sequences must then be assembled de novo before most genome analyses can begin. Unfortunately, genome assembly remains a very difficult problem, made more difficult by shorter reads and unreliable long-range linking information. In this study, we evaluated several of the leading de novo assembly algorithms on four different short-read data sets, all generated by Illumina sequencers. Our results describe the relative performance of the different assemblers as well as other significant differences in assembly difficulty that appear to be inherent in the genomes themselves. Three overarching conclusions are apparent: first, that data quality, rather than the assembler itself, has a dramatic effect on the quality of an assembled genome; second, that the degree of contiguity of an assembly varies enormously among different assemblers and different genomes; and third, that the correctness of an assembly also varies widely and is not well correlated with statistics on contiguity. To enable others to replicate our results, all of our data and methods are freely available, as are all assemblers used in this study.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.1028.html" target="_blank"><em>De novo</em> assembly and genotyping of variants using colored de Bruijn graphs</a></strong></p>

<p>Detecting genetic variants that are highly divergent from a reference sequence remains a major challenge in genome sequencing. We introduce <em>de novo</em>assembly algorithms using colored de Bruijn graphs for detecting and genotyping simple and complex genetic variants in an individual or population. We provide an efficient software implementation, <a href="http://cortexassembler.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Cortex</a>, the first <em>de novo </em>assembler capable of assembling multiple eukaryotic genomes simultaneously. Four applications of Cortex are presented. First, we detect and validate both simple and complex structural variations in a high-coverage human genome. Second, we identify more than 3 Mb of sequence absent from the human reference genome, in pooled low-coverage population sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Third, we show how population information from ten chimpanzees enables accurate variant calls without a reference sequence. Last, we estimate classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes at <em>HLA-B</em>, the most variable gene in the human genome.</p>
